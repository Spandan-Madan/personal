I am a PhD student at Harvard University working with [Professor Hanspeter Pfister](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/directory/pfister). My research involves explaining the performance of deep neural networks through the lens of Statistics and Visualization.

Apart from research, I am extremely passionate about teaching, and spend significant time writing tutorials/giving lectures in and around Boston. Click on the "Talks" or "Tutorials" section above for those. Actively seeking collaborators for side projects. This includes tutorials, and other tools I am interested in building. If interested, please drop me a mail.

**Past Research**

Before this, I was research assistant at MIT working with Fredo Durand on understanding the generalization behaviour of neural networks across variations in viewpoints, light source distributions, object poses and other scene atttributes. This summer I was working at Adobe Research with Connelly Barnes and Eli Schectman. In the past, I have been an intern at Microsoft Research Redmond, a master's student at Harvard University, and an undergraduate at IIT Delhi back home in India. Over this time, I have worked on machine learning applied to computer graphics, computer vision and computational biology during my undergrad.
